# GD Venezuela Bot

<p align="center"> <img src="./images/gdvnzla-banner.png" alt="Alt Text"> </p>

The GD Venezuela bot is designed to provide information to players from all over the country.
The information that the bot can provide are the statistics of each state of the country based on the roles assigned to users, mainly grinders, such as stars, moons, demons, user coins, etc. It can also provide complete information of the Venezuelan players on the [Demonlist](https://www.pointercrate.com/demonlist/), such as their global position, score and completed levels.

The option to link your Geometry Dash profile with the bot has been implemented to know in real time your stats and display them. All of this information is pulled from Robtop's servers.

The last feature that has been added to the bot is a small user XP monitoring system on the server that assigns a role to the most active users on the server. However, this task is a bit complicated, as the information is obtained from the ProBot bot by scraping. Maybe in the future it will be possible to automate it a bit more.
